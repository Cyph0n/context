# Context

The idea is to have a single text file that details your current context. This helps ease up working memory and let you focus on other things, like spending time with family and friends. Think of it as a barebones todo list.

More importantly, the file helps you switch between tasks you are currently working on and keeps track of where you are in each task. Once a task is done, remove it from the file.

Finally, whenever the file is changed, commit it to the repo to keep a history of contexts.

Thanks to some comments thread on HN for the idea.
